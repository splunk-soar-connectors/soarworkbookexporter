For example, if the suspicious email is sent to a dedicated email address for suspected phishing attempts, Phantom can poll that inbox directly with an App such as IMAP, EWS for Exchange, EWS for Office, or GSuite for GMail. This will create the event in Phantom and populate it with email headers, URL artifacts, domain artifacts, file attachments, to/from addresses, the text of the raw email, and other metadata. Alternatively, if the email is not already ingested directly into Phantom the \"get email\" action may be useful to retrieve it. For example, if a Splunk Notable Event based on the Email datamodel is used to detect a suspicious email, Phantom may be able to run \"get email\" to ingest the email based on the IMAP UID or other identifier. Another possible scenario is that the email of interest is included as an attachment on the email received by Phantom. In this case the \"extract email\" action may be able to ingest the email if it is in the .msg or .eml format.",

The malicious website may collect credentials or other confidential information, it may attempt to exploit the user's browser, it may lead the user to download a malicious file, or it may simply gather preliminary fingerprint information about the user to inform further operations. Investigate all URLs contained in the suspicious email using a mix of automated and manual techniques. Query threat intelligence services and other sources of reputation information to see if the URLs are linked to known malicious activity. Check the categorization of the URLs and their popularity using services such as Censys or Alexa. Determine whether the URL is spoofing a brand using a similar spelling, a unicode substitution, or an out-of-order domain name. Also consider using a less passive technique that analyzes the current state of the URL, such as a sandboxed URL detonation, a website scanning tool such as urlscan.io or SSL Labs, a manual inspection from a sandboxed environment, or a website screenshot engine such as ScreenShot Machine. Consider that targeted attacks may only reveal the malicious behavior of a website if the user agent and/or the source address of the request matches the target environment. The output of this task might be more linked URLs, the domain names of the underlying servers responding to the request, other domain names used by the website, IP addresses, or downloadable files. All of the above should be passed on to further investigative tasks if needed.",

Check each of these against threat intelligence and reputation databases, passive DNS trackers, whois services, and other information services. Look for known malicious or unknown domains, focusing more on those associated to clickable URLs and file attachments. Evaluate what services are running on each suspicious domain using a scanning service such as Censys or Shodan. Check the TLS certificate (if any), the website categorization, the popularity, and any other available information. Compare this information to the expected outcome given the alleged context of the email. For unknown domains, consider the domain history, the hosting provider, and whether the domain name appears to have been dynamically generated. IP addresses currently and previously associated with the domain should be further processed elsewhere in this case.",

The possibilities include emails that simply ask the receiver to reply with confidential information, emails that contain instructions to do insecure things, emails that manipulate automated systems which are parsing the email, and emails that prime the receiver for other interactions. Malicious emails often use current events such as tax season, a hurricane, or other publicly available information to establish a sense of trust or an illusion of urgency. Social engineering is perhaps the hardest technique to detect in an automated fashion, often requiring manual investigation. Consider the context of the message, the intended recipient, and the identity of the sender or alleged sender. It may be necessary to ask the recipient user if they think the email is legitimate.",
